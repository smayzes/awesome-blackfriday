# Contribution Guidelines

Unfortunately, not every black Friday deal can be considered for inclusion. The aim of Awesome Black Friday is to be a concise list of noteworthy and interesting technical deals.

Self-promotion is frowned upon, so please consider seriously whether your deal meets the criteria before opening a pull request, otherwise it may be closed without being reviewed.

Also, please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Enter a meaningful pull request description.
* Please make an individual commit for each suggestion in a separate pull request.
* Put a link to each library in your pull request ticket so it's easier to review.
* Use the following format for libraries: \[DEAL NAME\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorisation, are always welcome.
* Please keep descriptions short, simple and unbiased. No buzzwords or marketing jargon.
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
